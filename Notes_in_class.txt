Intro to git I (5/24/22 9am)
The benefit of version control!
 - You can see who did what change when
 - You can add notes to mark why changes were made
 - You can pick which version you need
 - You don't have to save the same file multiple times
Git allows version control locally, and GitHub is a collaborative
online version with additional features.

git config --global user.<___> "<___>"

*Turning a file/folder into a git repository for version control, etc.
 - cd into the folder (directory)
 - run command " git init "
 - can run " git status " in folder

*Adding files to git repository (add & commit)
 - (All of this done while cd in the folder/repository)
 - " git add <filename>
 - " git status " should display that you have things staged to commit
 - " git commit -m "<add note on commit>" "
 - " git log " displays the log of the commits done

*Editting files (add & commit)
 - After editing file, " git status " will show uncommited changes
 - You have to " git add " for any staging, multiple files can just 
	be listed with a space between

*Extrainious Bash code, etc.
 - command " ls --help "
 - Alternate file editor * nano *
 - Showing .csv header in bash, run " cat <___>.csv "
 - Alternative to shorten log display, run the command
	" git log --oneline "
